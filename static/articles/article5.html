                <p class="lead">Every day we grew up hearing the same phrase “ there’s always a second chance”, but in this context it could not be any more false. It is amusing and humorous how we believe that with time everything will resolve itself or sit still pretending there is another earth or a planet B to fall back on if this one perishes. 
                </p>

                <p class="lead">Rather than fantasising about a future that’s nearly a lifetime away, educating one another and altering part of our lifestyle to recover this planet is our priority. Every change starts with an individual’s atomic habits, and the change possible by us is unimaginable but the real question is who will take the first step isn’t it ?
                </p>
   
                  <p class="lead">The collaboration of Elon Musk and SpaceX is hardly unheard of. The common goal of the colonization of Mars has sparked interest and curiosity throughout the globe, and the project is truly one to be marvelled at, the idea itself that inhabitation of another planet is achievable is bizarre enough to make people question what technology is possible of. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="lead">However, are we really that deep in the grave that we dug for ourselves that we are already looking for replacements instead of prioritising the work needed in the current situation we live in ? The infinite possibilities that await in the possible future of residing on Mars is definitely a stimulating thought but has mankind crossed the point of no return ? 
                  </p>
                   
                  <p class="lead">Although an alternative cannot be brought forward in such a short period of time however letting this planet perish is definitely not an option! So the question here is what is to be done ? Do we change our day to day practices so drastically to save resources or just hope that if not us there is someone else willing to sacrifice their daily routine to bring a much required change ? 

                  <p class="lead">How is it possible for us to believe that this planet can easily be discarded like our everyday one time use of plastic or what has led us to assume that there isn’t even the slightest chance that this planet can be restored to its former state? We have to accept that mankind isn’t as invincible and imperishable as we make it seem to be, and there is a likely chance that humanity will perish due to our actions, however giving up and hoping for another planet to support humans isn’t a feasible choice.
 
                   <p class="lead">Therefore unless you truly believe in the idea of a “planet b” efforts are required to be made to save the current planet we inhabit. Minor changes brought to everyday routines and habits can make such a drastic difference even without our knowledge. Priority is key, after all a one in a million chance is still a chance.</p>
