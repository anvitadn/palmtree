                <p class="lead">Whether in a novel, podcast, magazine or conference, one may have heard the word altruistic, referring to the “disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others”, across varying contexts. If an individual has come across this word their mind may tend to drift towards social workers, and humanitarians, who are individuals or organizations concerned with promoting human welfare whether in serious situations or day to day challenges faced in everyday lives. 
                </p>

                <p class="lead">Similarly humanitarian aid isn’t an unfamiliar term when on the train of thought of humanitarians and social workers. Humanitarian aid or assistance is defined as <strong>“material and logistic assistance to people who need help and among the people in need are the homeless, refugees, and victims of natural disasters, wars, and famines [1].”</strong>
                </p>
   
                  <p class="lead">Along with global warming, climate change, and on a more positive note technological and healthcare advances, has come the rising need for humanitarian aid. The number of victims that require humanitarian assistance is steadily rising whether due to armed conflict or extreme climate events. Widespread hunger, displacement, death and destruction are just a few in the constantly growing list of issues that require aid. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="lead">Similarly increased vulnerability due to climate change, unsanitary living conditions, minimal hygiene, lack of sufficient water and sanitation has put a strain on the materials and funds required to provide global humanitarian assistance. According to GHO (global humanitarian overview) <strong>“In 2021, 235 million people will need humanitarian assistance and protection [2].”</strong> It is also stated that “this number has risen to 1 in 33 people worldwide from 1 in 45” since the launch of the GHO 2020.
                  </p>
                   
                  <p class="lead">When examined in depth or surface level, it is evident one of the main reasons for the need for aid is rising is both directly and indirectly due to human activities. Floods due to rising sea levels linking to melting of glaciers and icecaps, as well as hurricanes, heat waves, droughts, and storms, that would inevitably lead to destruction of property and displacement of individuals are largely caused due to climate change. </p>
 
                  <p class="lead">Furthermore, large scale homelessness, [3]forced migration, and long term refugee problems that require large funds and humanitarian assistance is also a result of internal armed conflict initiated by humans itself. Even though it is in our control to reduce the worldwide need of humanitarian assistance we choose to continue to harm humanity and ourselves.</p>
                   
                   <p class="lead">Sustainable and effective aid, although is being looked into and researched about, an ultimate goal of limiting the need for global aid should be set. An achievable goal, and one that can be overcome if approached with a growth and a determined mindset, the only drawback is if we consider the rising need for humanitarian aid an issue that requires solving?</p>
