              <p class="lead">Although rarely heard of, child abuse and marriage is not something that is nonexistent. An array of emotions tend to flow over us when the phrases abuse and child marriage are mentioned the predominant ones being rage, disbelief, incredulity, being appalled as well as a sense of shock. </p>

              <p class="lead">The possibility of such actions taking place itself is unimaginable that it is physically hard to believe that such things happen in our society, although without frequency. Though a large majority of us are privileged to live in family friendly homes and growing up in a pleasant surrounding as well as a welcoming environment, not each individual is gifted with this opportunity and the possible damage caused due to this could be potentially irreversible.</p>
 
                <p class="lead">Abuse. The first thought that comes to mind is a physical harm experienced by an individual at the hands of another. However, an entire past of this abuse is often not considered mental abuse. Children usually in their teens and pre-teens are often victims of this mental and emotional or psychological abuse. Whether at the hands of peers, coworkers, mentors or legal guardians, mental and emotional abuses isn’t as uncommon as we presume it to be. </p>

                <p class="lead">In modern society physical abuse has been deemed as inhumane and unacceptable yet education still lacks for mental and psychological abuse. <strong>“Mental abuse can be described as acts that can cause someone to feel insulted or demeaned or wear down someone’s self-esteem [1].”</strong> Whether in the form of bullying, usage of harsh language towards another, passive-aggressive comments, backhanded compliments, verbal abuse or mental manipulation, mental abuse often leads to long lasting impacts such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder and the development of destructive tendencies, and the damaged caused could be extremely harmful.</p>
                 
                <p class="lead">Another concept that makes us rethink the morals of the society we live in is the concept of child marriage. Although a rarely witnessed occurrence in the 21st century, it has not been completely abolished. </p>

                  <p class="lead">A marital union of a child under the age of 18 with parental consent can briefly be defined as child marriage. Although it affects the youth as a whole, child marriage generally has a greater impact on females. The situation of child marriage is severe in countries like <strong>, Bangladesh and Nepal and India accounting for one third of the globes total [2]</strong>. It is hard to accept that over <strong> million women today were married before the age of 18 [3].</strong> The risk of violence, abuse, and exploitation drastically increases due to child marriage and in girls reduces their access to education and their ability to achieve their full potential and more prone to domestic violence.</p>
                 
                 <p class="lead">Although personally I’m unable to relate to the topic of child abuse and marriage I wholeheartedly believe that it is not an issue that can be pushed to the side and should be prioritised for the sake of future and current generations after all the future is in our hands it’s our decision what to do with it.
