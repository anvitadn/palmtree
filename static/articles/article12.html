                <p class="lead">Terrorism and school shooting. A concept that requires no introduction, 
                  solely due to the occurrence of them in our world. The idea of thousands of innocent
                   and civilians dead at the hands of another with an ulterior motive with the unlawful 
                   use of violence and intimidation can loosely be classified within this category. 
                   Not an unknown situation, school shooting has resulted in the death of adolescents 
                   time and time again and is present even in the 21st century. Terrorism on the other
                    hand has been present for centuries yet the concept has not been completely abolished 
                    and is still partially evident in the modern society. Common morals and beliefs have slowly 
                    morphed, the abolishment of terrorism and school shooting into a goal that is being worked 
                   towards steadily, just is there enough time available?

                  <p class="lead">(1)Terrorism is defined in the Oxford Dictionary as “the unlawful use of 
                    violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.”
                     What differentiates terrorism from other forms of political violence and crimes against 
                     humanity? A necessity for a crime to be classified as terrorism requires it to be done 
                     against civilians with an intent to cause fear through the use of violence and threat 
                     of the use of violence. Terrorism has become a means of achieving ones political, religious, economic, or social goals via the destruction of public and private property and casualties.  Though hard to digest this information, terrorism has become more achievable in today’s everchanging and modernizing world. (2)This is due to the vast social media platforms and news that can spread the ideas that resort people to commit such a vile act at a rapid rate, as well as due to modern technology that aids in committing this crime.  One of the most distressing parts of terrorism is if it is caused due to discrimination of religion. Throughout decades of history we have seen that the majority resort to engage in violent actions to promote their beliefs. (3) “Some religious terrorists are inspired by defensive motives, others seek to ensure the predominance of their faith, and others are motivated by an aggressive amalgam of these tendencies''. What has led us to believe that one race or religion dominates others, and what is being done to change these preconceived notions?

                  <p class="lead">School shooting. It is astonishing that someone could have an impulse to use firearms against adolescents and teens that want to receive an education. The deaths of children and minors, predominantly in the United States, account for over (4)“2,900, and nearly 15,600 more are shot and injured. An estimated 3 million American children are exposed to shootings per year.” Even in 2020, the deaths of innocent people on a daily basis still take place, especially growing up in places like America where gun violence is extremely common. Why is it that the severity of the situation is only understood when we are personally affected by something, and what is being done to prevent the killing of people who hold the future in their palms? The prohibition and elimination of school shooting and terrorism has not only become a necessity nowadays but an common aim and objective to achieve, after all we hold the power to make a difference.</p>
