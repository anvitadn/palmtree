                <p class="lead">Resources, whether in the form of money, trees, fuels, as well as other natural energy resources as we know are depletable and there will come a time where they will not be easily available to us, the only thing that’s in our control is the time period they can last for. The rate at which humanity has consumed these limited resources is alarming and we are at brink of overconsumption. Whether non-renewable resources, commercial resources, or depletable resources, once used up completely we have to turn to new sources for a variety of uses which we are although on the path to, not completely ready for.  The question to be answered is at which point does it become too much, and with the growing need for these resources is not using them even an option?

                  <p class="lead"> 
                    Overconsumption is defined as (1)“the state or an instance of consuming too much (of a good or service), drink, fuel, etc.” However what can be identified as overconsumption? A day to day example could be the food we consume. Food is a necessity and under no circumstances should it be foregone as it is a requirement for our health and a source of nutrition. At what point does eating become binging, or how do we recognise the point at which consuming a good becomes more harmful than beneficial. Similarly resources provided by nature can also only be consumed till a particular amount till  consumption becomes excess. The harmful effects of overconsumption are indirect on humans and are more detectable on wildlife and nature. Overconsumption could possibly lead to exhaustion of the planet's natural support systems that both fauna and humans rely on.

                  <p class="lead">Resource depletion is an uprising problem that is becoming considerably harder for us to solve solely due to the fact that a large majority of the resources we use are rarely replaceable. Humanity is consuming limited resources at a rate faster than at which it can be replenished such as fossil fuels, water, mineral depletion as well as animals such as fishes. What is surprising even something considered as a renewable resource, water, is also faced with the threat of depletion. What we fail to understand that it is a possibility that resource depletion may (2)affect the global economy, and GDP even before the impacts of global warming are taken into consideration.  Consecutive events such as strain of food resources due to infertile land, lack of availability of drinking water, as well as loss of biodiversity.</p>
