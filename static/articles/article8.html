                <p class="lead">The Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, numerous lakes, seas, ponds, and oceans, all are extremely significant parts of this globe yet remain underappreciated and denied the attention they deserve. Taken for granted these water bodies have become a necessary part for our survival as well as in combination to the very bane of our existence and there is no one to blame apart from us. 
 
                </p>

                <p class="lead">Pollution has become such a common term in our dictionary that it rarely fazes anyone anymore, just another day to day used word that has not received the seriousness and importance it deserves. It can be argued that measures are being taken to reduce the impact of pollution but is it sufficient enough ?
 
                </p>
   
                  <p class="lead">Oceans are polluted to the extend where one does not know where clean seawater starts and where it ends, thousands of liters of water contaminated, marine life vastly affected from fishes to whales, impacts of water pollution are visible right in front of our eyes from the demise of creatures vital in the food chain to indirect effects on human beings yet we continue to turn a blind eye toward the situation. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="lead">We fail to understand that we are on the path of digging our own grave, and ignoring the problem will not solve it. From the toxic substances in our drinking water to the possible spread of diseases due to consumption of infected sea creatures (due to toxins) as seafood as well as the lack of water safe for consumption, for all we ourselves are at fault and sitting still is equivalent to giving up.
                  </p>
                   
                  <p class="lead">It has said that we have only explored 5 percent of the ocean has been topographically imaged, that leaves 95 % of the secrets held beneath these water bodies uncovered. Humans have progressed so far that instead of focusing on what is present on the planet we live, more advanced technology is present to gain knowledge about outer space from the possibility of the inhabitation of Mars to the exploration of Venus. </p> 

                  <p class="lead">The harsh reality however is that if changes are not brought soon, we may never get to experience the vast possibilities of marine sea life that are yet to be discovered or the species of flora and fauna present on the sea floors that remain a mystery. The idea of external life intrigues us to such an extent that we forget to marvel at the infinite beings present in these oceans surrounding us.</p> 

                   <p class="lead">The only question left to ask is if it is finally too late to repair the damage done ? </p>
