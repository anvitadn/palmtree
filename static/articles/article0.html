                <p class="lead">Climate change. A topic that has been spoken about multiple times yet people are unable to understand the severity of the situation. I could provide you with statistical and analytical data, with facts and figures but in reality what impact does that make ? 
                </p>

                <p class="lead">Burning forests, greenhouse gases polluting the air we inhale, acid rain, sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere, all of them are phrases that we grew up learning, but as time progresses the action being taken reduces and the devastating impact caused multiplies. It isn’t that we are unaware or oblivious, but conflicting views about such topics restrict major actions to be taken.
                </p>
   
                  <p class="lead">The United Nations define climate change as <strong>“a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods[1].” </strong> However on a personal level what does climate change mean to us as an individual? 
                  </p>

                  <p class="lead">Do we believe it to be a hoax, or a driving force as something to resolve. The devastating impacts are prominent in our everyday lives ranging from something as insignificant to not wearing a jacket on an unusual sweltering day or just a one degree rise in the local neighbourhood climate.
                  </p>
                   
                  <p class="lead">“So what if the temperature has increased by 1 degree Fahrenheit, the air conditioning and cooling systems will be left on throughout the day, affordability is not a problem” though a valid statement the situation goes far deeper beneath the surface. Although for us it may seem like a matter of turning on a switch, for nature however it is the changing of their adaptations completely. </strong></p>

                  <p class="lead">Anecdotal as well as scientific evidence can be provided by the corals present in Bali. A minor fluctuation in the temperature caused the once vibrant corals to bleach. <strong>“The first global scientific assessment of climate change impacts on World Heritage coral reefs, published in 2017 by UNESCO, predicts that the coral reefs in all 29 reef-containing World Heritage sites would cease to exist as functioning coral reef ecosystems by the end of this century if humans continue to emit greenhouse gases[2]."</strong>
                  </p>

                   <p class="lead">Although climate change’s  impacts aren’t shown visibly, it has the capability to destroy ecosystems, ones that are vital for our survival. Waiting till the repercussions finally catch up to us is the equivalent of giving up completely. Small changes may seem worthless and unnecessary, but the power held within them is astronomical and just a small alteration in our lifestyle can go a long way!</p>
