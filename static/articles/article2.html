                <p class="lead">Dining. A word that is extremely common in our dictionary whether it is the luxury of fine dining in expensive restaurants or just a stop at the local fast food store. Majority of the time when we crave a particular food item it is within our palms in a matter of seconds and worrying about going a day without nutrients and meals has never been a concern. We are granted with the privilege of having three nutritious meals a day and food always available for us at any time of the day. Similarly, access to clean water and beverages has been within our reach and just a tap away, however what about millions of individuals, who’s main daunting task is to provide food and water for themselves? Living such a lifestyle seems nearly impossible and only when we are placed in such circumstances the gravity of the situation falls upon us and we are faced with the harsh reality of the conditions millions are forced to survive in.
                </p>
   
                  <p class="lead">A variety of factors affect the shortage of food and water even for individuals who are not faced with the additional burden of poverty. The most straightforward one being the domino effect created due to global warming. Water shortages for irrigation, drought, infertile land, acid rain due to pollution leading to the destruction of crops, rapidly melting glaciers and ice caps and the examples can continue. Although such shortages are faced by various countries and people it is largely centralized in Africa. (1)” 226.7 million people are starving in Africa. The countries most affected by extreme poverty and hunger in Africa are mainly those located south of the Sahara. One in four people suffers from hunger there – which means that the share of the world's hungry is highest in sub-Saharan Africa.``

                  <p class="lead">The subsequent chain of events following food shortage, is what makes this situation a pressing concern to deal with nowadays. Lack of sufficient nutrition makes people vulnerable to various diseases and heath malfunctions. A few being malnutrition, Vitamin deficiency, marasmus, kwashiorkor, resulting in an increase in death tolls, and apart from that over (2) 10,000 deaths solely due to starvation per day. Food insecurity similarly links to the common problem of (3) “the disruption of food intake or eating patterns because of lack of money and other resources.” Failure to realise how gifted a large part of us are, prevents education about this topic. We believe that it is a default system to come home and have food on the table although thousands are not presented with that opportunity, however even with minimal co-operation the unnerving task of overcoming famine and starvation wouldn’t seem like an unachievable goal.</p>
