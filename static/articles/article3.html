                <p class="lead">Forest, trees responsible for our survival needed for shade and shelter, provide wood and timber for construction, fuel for various purposes, source of fruits and nutrition and the list can continue. Fires,(3) “a process in which substances combine chemically with oxygen from the air and typically give out bright light, heat, and smoke; combustion or burning”. These vastly different words do not belong in the same sentence yet humanity and its actions have made it possible. Forest fires unfortunately are not an unknown concept to us, and its devastating impacts and consequences even more evident in the twenty-first century. It is both eye opening, and humorous in a morbid way that with our intervention a blessing to nature, trees can be manipulated to be one of the worst pollutants in our atmosphere (the greenhouse gases secreted when substances are burned).

                  <p class="lead">2020 a year that started off with a bang and its closure will be no less dramatic. This historic year itself started off with bush fires that flooded social media sites and the news due to its consequences and appalling impacts. The bushfires that took place in Australia, spilling on from 2019 over to 2020 had severe casualties of both flora, fauna as well as human casualties including firefighters and civilians. (1) “11 million hectares (110,000 square km or 27.2 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia have been burned.” Living elsewhere and not experiencing these effects directly or first-hand tend to lead us to subconsciously believe that the impacts aren’t as disastrous as they seem. Why is it that something is only significant to us, to people like you and I,  if we are personally affected by it ?
                  </p>
                   
                  <p class="lead">However, one of the most distressing parts of the Australian bush fires were the millions of lives of creatures harmed, leading us just a step closer to witnessing the possible extinction of numerous species. A recent study released by scientists from Australian universities stated that (2)”2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, 143 million mammals and 51 million frogs were harmed in the blazes that ripped through the country.” How many more animals need to be lost, trees burned to ashes till the gravity of the situation is finally engraved into our minds? We learn about the significance of trees from our childhood, and how the preservation of them is not an option but a necessity yet even after decades we are in a worse position than before, so the question is do we consider this situation as a priority or not ?</p>
