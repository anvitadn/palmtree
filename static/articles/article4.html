                <p class="lead">A daily routine of youths from teenagers to graduates is to wake up at dawn and go through the repetitive lifestyle of attending classes on an average for 6-7 hours, 5 days per week. At the ripe age of five we are introduced to the schooling system that becomes part of our lives over time and attending school becomes like a second skin for us. 
                </p>

                <p class="lead">Adolescents often take receiving an education for granted and going to school is often considered as an unfortunate situation and is treated as an obligation. What we fail to realize is that there are millions of adults as well as children that do not have the privilege of attaining a sufficient education that impacts the decisions made in their future. Lack of education as well as access to it is a significant issue that has made individuals question whether it is a situation that can be solved or not?
                </p>
   
                  <p class="lead">Education has become a steadily growing necessity in an individual's life without which it is considered near impossible to achieve something in life. Satisfactory grades are prioritized and the constant pressure of not being good enough or at the top of the class weights down on students. However, what about those who have never received an opportunity to showcase their potential or intelligence? 
                  </p>

                  <p class="lead">Being educated provides a source of income, as well as the ability to attain a stable job and a better standard of living, but without it is hard not to fall back into the ongoing cycle of poverty or even have the opportunity to escape it. Lack of education further instigates events such as exploitation, unemployment, and a shorter life span that goes to show the long lasting impacts of not receiving an education.
                  </p>
                   
                  <p class="lead"><strong>”More than 72 million children of primary education age are not in school and 759 million adults are illiterate [1]”.</strong> Illiteracy, a consequence of lack of education, is rising up to be one of the major issues being faced by today’s society. The limited access to education is also an uprising challenge to overcome. </p>

                  <p class="lead">Limited number of qualified teachers, studying materials like textbooks and learning materials, and sufficient spacing for desks and chairs for students to be seated on, poses a challenge for individuals to attain a high level of education. Although a large majority facing this problem, are those with inadequate financial support and are hence unable to afford the cost of attending school.  Lack of education is only one of the numerous challenges faced by our society and although it may seem impossible to overcome we will never know the reality if we don’t make an effort to try.</p>
