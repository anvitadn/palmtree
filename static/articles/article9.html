                <p class="lead">Ethnic cleansing is described as (1) ” a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas.” Throughout history variety of examples have time and time again been witnessed of ethnic cleansing that could be described as genocide.(2) The evidence of provable intent of eliminating an entire group of peoplem is necessary for it to be classified as genocide although the convicted individual can still be guilty of ethnic cleansing. Furthermore genocide is designated as an international crime by the united nations whereas ethnic cleansing is a descriptive term.

                  <p class="lead">A recent survey I conducted showed individuals knowledge about Ethnic cleansing. 46% of the majority have rarely even heard of the phrase ethnic cleansing, 39% have come across the phrase periodically and a mere 15% have previous knowledge about the topic. This evidently portrays the lack of education about a serious topic that could be worked on. Furthermore 62% also had a preconceived notion about Ethnic cleansing being classified as racism. This to a large extent can be justified due to the main motive of ethnic cleansing being the removal of an ethnic, racial or religious group. The only difference is that racism is more globally known in comparison. The survey also showed that 65% were more aware about famous examples such as the Nazi Holocaust of European Jews in comparison to others such as (3)the Armenian massacres by the Turks or Soviet Union’s deportation of certain ethnic minorities.

                    The first genocide of the 21st century, Darfur genocide, is a result of ethnic killing taking place in Western Sudan.(4) The provoking event that led to the killings of millions was the rebellion against the Sudanese government in claims that they where ethnically cleansing Africans out of Darfur. This resulted in militant group Janjaweed going after innocent civilians as well against the JME and SLA in hopes to silent the rebels. Janjaweed are held accountable for deaths as well as crimes such as rape, bombing of villages, pillage, as well as forcible displacement of millions. It is hard for us to believe that even after decades of development issues like ethnic cleansing exist. Although I’m unable to relate with the hardships faced by millions due to being subjected to oppression, I wholeheartedly agree that nothing is justifiable to make an individual or organisation resort to ethnic cleansing.</p>
                    
                   
                   <p class="lead">There isn’t an option of leaving this matter unresolved and although an intimidating task, for the sake of us as well as future generations eradicating ethnic cleansing has become a necessity that needs to be overcome.</p>
