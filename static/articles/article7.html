                <p class="lead">Individual versus one of it's kind, brother against brother, the shame and disappointment felt cannot even be described with the mere use of words felt throughout the globe from parents worrying about the well-being of their children just while roaming the streets, to the heartbreaking conversations about the threats being faced due to something that one cannot control. 
                </p>

                <p class="lead">Has our society come to the point where race, religion, ethnicity, colour, and one's beliefs and moral values determine where we stand in today’s world ?
                </p>
   
                  <p class="lead">Has the infamous tale of concentration camps during World War Two taught us nothing ? We refer back to those times as something undesirable and the dark ages, convincing and lying to ourselves that we are much developed and civilized in comparison to them, but in reality, other than the excessive use of smartphones, how different are we in comparison ? 
                  </p>

                  <p class="lead">I could provide you with tangible evidence and statistics but would that be sufficient enough to change the mentality of people from decades ago that is still very much alive in the 21 century or would it convince one to go against something that is so deeply engraved in their conscience, like a parasite, near impossible to break away from ?
                  </p>
                   
                  <p class="lead">Oppression faced by millions solely based on their skin colour, discrimination against another race, the infamous “caste system” originated in ancient India, such inhumane actions take place globally everyday yet we choose to shut our eyes and pretend there isn’t a flaw in the world we live in and that if we ignore the problem it will just disappear. </p>

                  <p class="lead">What joy is experienced by believing that we stand above someone else, or thinking we are superior than another ? Instead of uniting humanity to face global threats of global warming and pollution as a whole, we find sadistic pleasure in turning ourselves against each other. </p>
 
                  <p class="lead">Excuses such as “it isn’t within our capability, after all we are just citizens trying to get through the day” or “how will one person revolutionize and tear through layers of outdated beliefs “ are the only things restricting us from possibly bringing the much required change needed in our society. If the infinite power we hold within the grasp of our palm, we day to day workers, students, children, parents, becomes evident in our eyes, the change needed won’t seem like such an unimaginable burden to overcome. The only question is whether we are willing to fight for a future, isn’t it ?</p>
