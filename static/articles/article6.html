               <p class="lead">A large majority of us are privileged to come back to a place known as home with hot food and water served to us at our convenience. Life is practically handed to us on a silver plate and at the snap of a finger most things are at arm's length for us, whether it is leisure activities or a chance to receive education. However there are people globally who do not have access to the basic necessities of life from basic nutrition to shelter. As humans it is our tendency to restrict our thinking to our own well-being which prevents us from looking at the larger picture and millions others who are not as fortunate as we have come to be. Poverty is a concept not a lot of us can relate with on a personal level, which causes us to narrow our line of vision of the way people live in today’s world, although being ignorant of this situation does not make it disappear.</p>
   
                  <p class="lead">Poverty is defined as (1)“the lack of income and productive resources to ensure sustainable livelihoods.” A measure of poverty is when an individual is placed below the international poverty line which is sustaining a living at less than $1.90 a day. We are taught about the vicious cycle of poverty that is near impossible to break out of, since grade school and a real life example of it can be witnessed throughout the globe. The factor that makes poverty a serious issue is the never-ending nature of it. If one is born into poverty no matter the skills and wit they possess, due to lack of financial aid, it becomes a challenge to pursue after it. A large number of us will never individually get to experience the hardships faced by millions, due to something that is hardly in their control, so it is definitely a question to ponder over that till what extent do we tend to undermine the effects of poverty?
                  </p>
                   
                  <p class="lead">Numerous measures have been taken in hope of reducing the impacts of poverty such as setting up of non-profit organisations, (2)creating and improving access to jobs and basic social services as well as progressively taking actions to help break out of the cycle of poverty.  However, this is not a problem that can be solved overnight. A goal of ending poverty by 2030 was also set previously by the world leaders to (3)“end poverty in all its forms everywhere” proving that ending poverty isn’t just a fantasy anymore, but a possible reality for mankind. The only thing standing in our path are ourselves, and it’s the decision of whether to overcome this barrier or not, that is to be made to make this dream a possibility.</p>
