                <p class="lead">Vaccinations, lipsticks, numerous makeup products, band-aids, and Vaseline. Most of these items are day to day household items that we use every day and although they fall on various ends of the spectrum each of these products have something in common. Hundreds and thousands of animals had to be scarified to ensure these goods are in our palms today. 
                </p>

                <p class="lead">Animal testing is a well-known phrase throughout the globe in various different contexts and is often dismissed as a trivial or insignificant issue worldwide. Deaths of creatures of various sizes, shapes, and colors are caused to ensure our safety which is made a priority which although is a necessity settles a feeling of guilt within us, and makes us question whether indirect harm of animals is worth any product we purchase?
                </p>
   
                  <p class="lead">Animal testing, whether due to its success, assurance or availability of animals, is used across a variety of fields, industries and firms and although has been proven to be a large advantage doesn’t come without its downside. Day in and day out we are surrounded by animal cruelty products without our knowledge, and are ignorant about the suffering faced by these creatures that walk the earth alongside us. 
 
                  </p>

                  <p class="lead">Cruelty free international describes an animal test as <strong>“any scientific experiment or test in which a live animal is forced to undergo something that is likely to cause them pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm [1].”</strong> Force feeding with harmful substances, causing deliberate damage to organs and tissues, forced inhalation of toxic gases, subjecting an individual to frightening situations, all are considered unacceptable when subjected to humans, however shouldn’t it apply to animals as well?
 
                  </p>
                   
                  <p class="lead">It would be false however to say that humanity has not benefited via the use of animals in laboratories. Animals, mammals  in particular are partially similar to humans which aid researchers while conducting experiments. Mice, one of the most used animals in animal testing <strong>“share more than 98% DNA [2]“</strong> with humans. Hence making them susceptible to common health problems such as cancer and heart disease. </p>

                  <p class="lead">Furthermore animal research has led to the development of vaccines against Polio, and Tuberculosis. It is acceptable that we aren’t advanced in technology till the extent where animals can be forgone in research, however animal testing becoming an uprising issue that requires our undivided attention.</p>
 
                   <p class="lead">A gruesome picture becomes prominent in our imagination of animals being burned, abused and crippled and sacrificed all in the name of science. Although alternatives are being discovered such as organ on a chip [3], if animal testing does not receive the attention it requires the impacts could be a lot more devastating than we presume.</p>
