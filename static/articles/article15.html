                <p class="lead">Human rights, as distinguished from the word, are basic rights that every individual is deserving of regardless of their age, race, gender, ethnicity, religion or status. Even something as trivial as privacy is considered a human right and is expected of people, it may not always be provided to everyone. According to the United Nations a few of the basic human rights include (1)the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work and education, access to water and sanitation and countless others. Majority of these, we expect to be provided as a default, however the harsh truth that numerous people do not have access to things we take for granted comes as a wakeup call for privileged individuals like us.
                </p>
   
                  <p class="lead">It may be questioned what significance do human rights hold for a human being? Human rights determine the basic standard of living for millions and ensure they live with dignity, and have the freedom to choose their path in life and follow their beliefs. Freedom, something everyone wishes to have, is provided by these human rights and enables individuals to express themselves, and state their opinion on different matters, in other words gives us the freedom of speech. Human rights also become a medium of guaranteeing people basic amenities required for survival such as food, shelter, as well as an education to provide them with an option to take advantage of opportunities presented to them. Furthermore they guarantee equality, liberty and security protecting people from being victims of abuse at the hand of more powerful individuals.

                  <p class="lead">Human rights, although are universal, inalienable and non-discriminatory, the violation as well as the lack of access to them are more frequent than we assume it to be. We are aware that enslavement is a violation of human rights yet (2) ”approximately 27 million people are currently enslaved in the human trafficking trade around the world.” People have been arrested over something as insignificant as surfing the internet and expressing their opinions on the web, due to governments monitoring their internet usage. (3) “People in China have been arrested and charged for using the Internet as a tool to spread human rights information.” Human rights are provided conditionally and although it should be accessible to everyone it isn’t to millions who are victims of oppression or discrimination such as people with disabilities (4) who are provided with poorer education opportunities and have minimal control over their own lives and choices.</p>
 

                   
                   <p class="lead">Access to basic human rights should be a default in everyone’s lives and no one should have to fight for the rights they are deserving of. Human rights is an entitlement not a privilege, the sooner this is understood the faster this issue of lack of access to human rights can be won.
