                <p class="lead">Beauty is visible in a variety of forms, shapes, colors, beings, flora, fauna and extraordinary creatures walking the earth alongside us humans. From the smallest creature at 1.1 inches, Kitty’s hog nosed bat to the largest sea creature roaming international waters. Innumerable species yet to be discovered, genes to be researched, the unceasing curiosity of scientists yet to be quenched, as well as witnessing exquisite and alluring colour combinations on creatures skin, so much yet to be done but an inadequate amount of time left to do so. 
                </p>

                <p class="lead">Extinction. Not an unheard word, but not nearly spoken enough about. The possibility of not being able to glimpse an animal, as common as an elephant now, in a couple of decades is terrifying so the question is what will we do to prevent it ?
                </p>
   
                  <p class="lead">Animals are present in our day to day life whether in the form of food, companions, accessory, clothing and even as an outlet for a hobby. They play an extremely significant part in our lives, yet are still taken for granted. Even if not directly, animals are exceedingly important in the food chain as well as in the ecosystem so what has led us to believe that they are as disposable as we make them to be? 
                  </p>

                  <p class="lead">Animals are brutally murdered to give us a leather handbag or belt, and we are taught to believe that animals can be exploited as long as our needs and wants remain satisfied, millions of animals sacrificed in the name of science and development and yet we assume there is not a problem in the way we live.
                  </p>
                   
                  <p class="lead">It’s a well fact that poaching has been deemed illegal for a variety of reasons due to it being a major threat to wildlife globally and loss of biodiversity, but only a small portion of wildlife trade is considered illegal such as poaching of tigers and elephants for their tusks, skin, and bones. Is overexploitation of marine turtles not considered cruelty or usage of animals in production of cosmetics and medicines ? </p>

                  <p class="lead">What has led us to presume that our actions are acceptable, is it because we think we are at the top of the food chain or simply chose to be ignorant about the fact that such gruesome actions take place under our noses. It is true that legal global wildlife trade contributes to a large part of the economy, worth $300 billion and provides a source of income as well as employment but if things continue the way they are there won’t be a requirement for money at all.</p>

                   
                   <p class="lead">The harsh truth is that we require animals to survive, and the sooner this fact is accepted the faster measures can be taken. It's our decision what to do with the limited time left after all.</p>
